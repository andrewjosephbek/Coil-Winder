# Goals and Requirements

Requirements describe features that must be implemented, goals are features that may be added once a minimum viable product is achieved.

## Requirements

- Wind coils with a minimum diameter of 25cm
- Reliably wind a tightly packed first wire layer 
    - e.g. minimal space between wraps
- Accomplish all previous requirements with a minimum wire size of 30awg 
- Operate the Coil Winder through an integrated user interface 

## Goals

- Design a system to ensure non initial layers are tightly packed
    - e.g. successive layers are wrapped within the root of previous layers
- Design an arbor standard with space for a time of flight (ToF) sensor to read the radius of the Arbor at the current winding position
    - Use sensor data to adjust arbor speed, and automatically read arbor radius.
- Wind coils with a minimum diameter of 50cm
- Accomplish all previous goals with a minimum wire size of 32awg
